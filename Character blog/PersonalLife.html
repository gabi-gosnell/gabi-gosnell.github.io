        <P>My personal life is nothing special. Well, no, it is, but I don't like talking about it. I guess... well, my day job is working as an archivist. It's nothing fun, just organizing files. My coworkers are nice, not asking too many questions, and they respect my boundaries. So it's not the worst thing in the world. I think some of them are scared of me, causing them to be extra nice.</P>
        <p>I don't really like the ones that are afraid of me. The intense, artificial pleasentries are annoying. They act like I'll hurt them for <i>breathing</i> wrong which, again, is just annoying. I'm just there so I have a steady income.</p>
