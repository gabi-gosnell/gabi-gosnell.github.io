        <h1>My <i>other</i> job</h1>
        <p>My line of work isn't very traditional, or legal really, but I still do it. I'm an assassin. I have limits, of course. I don't take just any job. And I'll only harm people who've hurt others. People who I believe deserve it.</p>
        <p>Of course, I won't kill children, and I won't go after just a random person who hasn't done anything specifically wrong. Of course, anyone who needs me, knows where to find me. If you don't, you can contact me at Zero@emailservice.com</p>
        <h2>Not a real email address. Don't contact it.</h2>
        <p>We can go into more specifics if I decide to take the job. And you can rely on me to always get it done.</p>
