        <h1>This is for myself.</h1>
        <p>I used to have friends. But I always felt a little jealous. Left out. Part of the whole "Zero" thing, but I digress. They were all strong, and I was in the background. I hated it. I prefer it now, but then... I wanted to be a part of something. When I was able to go out with them, they died. It was poor planning, and there was no one to warn them something was wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was my job to warn them. It was my job to plan and map out routes, and keep watch and everything. But I wasn't able to do that. I still blame myself. I've been finding ways to distract myself. Doing assassin work. It's hard, sometimes. And I don't always take the job. But it keeps me busy. Maybe I should go to therapy, like people suggest. But how am I supposed to explain what happened? Who would ever believe me? It's easier not thinking about it. Well, you found this. So I guess you at least deserve that much.</p>
