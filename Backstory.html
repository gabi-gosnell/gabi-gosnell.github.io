        <h1>I'm only adding this because I know someone will be curious.</h1>
        <P>When I was younger, I actually had friends. Good ones too. We did basically everything together. Even had the same line of work! But... that work was dangerous, and some things happened, and to  be quick, I don't have friends anymore.</P>
        <p>Do I miss them? Of course I do. I miss them every day. I stopped socializing because missing them hurts too much. And I don't want to hurt again. It's hard to connect, anyways. People don't approach me unless they want something. But that's ok. I don't really care.</p>
        <p>Or maybe I do. I don't really know anymore. But that's getting too personal for me.</p>
